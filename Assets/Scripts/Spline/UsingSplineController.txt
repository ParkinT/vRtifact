Using Hermite Spline Controller

Attach SplineController to object that will be moving (may get errors initially, this is fine)

Create an empty object as a parent for all spline nodes

Populate empty object with empty children, each of which represent a node along the spline. Must be alphabetically ordered in the hierarchy (recommend Node001, Node002, Node 003, etc…)

disable AutoStart and AutoClose on your SplineController

to begin moving the object along the spline send the message (or call the function) “Play” to the SplineController object

to receive a message on animation completion, set a callback function to the splineControllers onComplete, ex below

public void myFunc() {
…
}

splineController.onComplete = myFunc;

myFunc will be called on completion.
